Add custom tabs with content to products in WooCommerce. 

== Description ==

This plugin lets you import your [Custom Product Tabs for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/yikes-inc-easy-custom-woocommerce-product-tabs/) using [WP All Import](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import/).

All of your saved custom product tabs will be loaded into the familiar WP All Import user interface. When defining your import, look for the Custom Product Tabs section. For each saved tab, you can choose to ignore it, apply it as is (as a saved tab), or apply it as a custom tab (and customize the tite/content).

Please be aware that importing custom product tabs will wipe out existing tabs for the product before applying the new ones.

<i>This plugin was developed by [Yikes, Inc.]() and the [WP All Import]() team.</i>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What plugins do I need to use this plugin? =
This plugin relies on three other plugins: [Custom Product Tabs for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/yikes-inc-easy-custom-woocommerce-product-tabs/) to create your tabs, [WP All Import](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import/) to import data, and [WP All Import's WooCommerce Extension](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-xml-csv-product-import/) to import WooCommerce Products.

= Can I add tabs to existing products with this plugin? =
You can add tabs to existing products, but it will wipe out any tabs you currently have for that product.

= Can I add tabs to a subset of products in my import file? =
No. The options for applying/ignoring custom product tabs will be applied to all of the products in your import file.

= What is a saved tab vs. a custom tab? =
Saved and custom tabs come from the [Custom Product Tabs for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/yikes-inc-easy-custom-woocommerce-product-tabs/). A custom tab is defined for a single product, while a saved tab can be applied to as many products as you'd like.
